# Package Organization

Dependencies flow downward only.

## Layers

### Layer 1: Main (`cmd/fleetshift` and `internal/main`)

CLI commands, config serialization, object graph and object lifecycle. No business logic. Thin front to layers 2 and sometimes directly to 3. Initializes objects from layer 5.

Depends on: Transport and Infrastructure, sometimes Application and Domain (when the CLI is acting as "the transport")

### Layer 2: Transport (`internal/transport`)

Wire protocols, serialization, and transport level middleware. gRPC server lives here. No business logic.

- Depends on: Application, Domain

Notable sub-packages for dynamic API extensibility:

- **`transport/dynamicapi`** — shared leaf: dynamic gRPC mux (`DynamicServiceMux`), dynamic HTTP mux (`DynamicHTTPMux`), file registry, proto compiler, composite reflection, and exported helpers (field builders, timestamp marshaling, HTTP utilities). Has no knowledge of specific resource types.
- **`transport/extensionresource`** — extension services: service builder and gRPC/HTTP handlers for addon-defined extension APIs, plus the `DynamicSchemaActivator` that orchestrates schema compilation and mux registration.
- **`transport/platformresource`** — platform-canonical services: service builder and handlers for platform resource identity APIs (labels, representations, aliases).

### Layer 3: Application (`internal/application`)

Protocol-agnostic operations using domain value objects. Cross-cutting concerns like observability and transaction boundaries.

- Depends on: Domain

### Layer 4: Domain (`internal/domain`)

Core business logic: graph resolution, usersets, sharding, routing, rebalancing. Defines interfaces for external infrastructure.

- Depends on: nothing (no other layer)

### Layer 5: Infrastructure (`internal/infrastructure/{vendor}`)

Vendor-specific implementations of domain interfaces (e.g., postgres, memory).

- Depends on: Domain

Shared, vendor-neutral infrastructure helpers may also live as siblings under `internal/infrastructure/` when more than one vendor package needs them. Today:

- **`infrastructure/querysql`** — CEL-to-SQL filter compilation for QueryResources (AST lowering, parameter binding). Postgres and SQLite each supply a `FieldResolver` and a `ParamBinder` (`DollarParams` `$N` / `QuestionParams` `?N`); they do not own the CEL subset.

## Rules

- Domain must not import from transport, application, or infrastructure
- Application must not import from transport or infrastructure
- Infrastructure implements domain interfaces; it does not define new shared abstractions (only those it needs internally)
- New external dependencies (databases, services) get their own infrastructure package
- Shared SQL/CEL helpers that are not vendor-specific belong in a sibling package under `infrastructure/`, not nested under one vendor
